Project: Chess Game - JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Description:
A fully functional chess game built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project implements core chess mechanics including piece movement, valid moves validation, check/checkmate detection, and turn-based gameplay.

Features:
- Complete chess board with 64 squares and standard piece positions
- Drag-and-drop piece movement with visual feedback
- Move validation according to chess rules
- Turn management (White/Black)
- Check and checkmate detection
- Piece promotion (basic pawn to queen)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Clean, modern UI with CSS animations

How it Works:
1. Game initializes with standard chess starting position
2. Players drag pieces to valid destination squares
3. JavaScript validates moves based on piece type and position
4. Game state tracks board position, current turn, and game status
5. Visual indicators show legal moves and check status

Usage:
1. Open index.html in any modern web browser
2. Play as White (starts first) or Black
3. Drag pieces to move them to valid squares
4. Game ends with checkmate detection
